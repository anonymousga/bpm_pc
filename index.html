							Forrester Total Economic Impact Study Underscores Financial Impact of Camunda for Enterprise Customers
							
							Process automation provider Camunda today announced findings from a commissioned, newly published Total Economic ImpactTM (TEI) study conducted by Forrester Consulting. The study examined the potential return on investment (ROI) organizations may realize by adopting the Enterprise Edition of Camunda, which revealed a 389% ROI and net present value (NPV) of $20.08M over a three-year period.

							""Why Camunda is not covered in the Gartner iBPMS MQ
							
							First, it’s important to understand that “iBPMS” is not actually a software category, it is a term invented by Gartner a few years ago and has never been picked up by anyone else (to illustrate this, here’s a google trend report comparing search volumes for “iBPMS” vs “Camunda”).
							
							In the beginning of the report, Gartner defines an iBPMS as:
							An iBPMS is a type of high-productivity (low-code/no-code) application development platform.
							
							And this is exactly what Camunda BPM is not and was never meant to be.
							
							When we started Camunda BPM in 2013, we followed our hypothesis that the existing BPMS products in the market implemented a flawed approach, which is exactly the approach Gartner describes to define an iBPMS.""
